    <p>The Moon is Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is one of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). It is the second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known (after Jupiter's satellite Io).

    The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. There are several hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.</p>

    <h3>Top 3 moon facts</h3>
    <ol  type="A">
        <li>The moon is moving away from us. Each year, the moon steals some of Earth's rotational energy, and uses it to propel itself about 1.6 inches (4 centimeters) higher in its orbit.</li>
        <li> Tides on Earth are caused mostly by the moon (the sun has a smaller effect)</li>
        <li>The moon is not round (or spherical). Instead, it's shaped like an egg.</li>
